Solves Dr Brain Motor Programming

In one of my educational games I had when I was a kid, there was a really really hard minigame where you had to control a robot.
At some point last year, I wrote a program that would solve it for me.

See the readme folder for more details. :P

TODO: I forgot how to run this thing and the readme in the folder wrongly assumes there's a jar file.

If I remember, I'll figure out how this program is run.

If I don't remember, please remind me.
